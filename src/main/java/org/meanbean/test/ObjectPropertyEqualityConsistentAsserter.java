   * It is permissible to check the equality of two objects when no change has been made to the named property. This

   *                              of its named property.
   * @param originalPropertyValue The original value of the modified property. This should still be the value of the named property in
   *                              the original object.
   * @param newPropertyValue      The new value of the named property in the modified object.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException If any of the parameters are deemed illegal. For example, if any are <code>null</code>.
   * @throws AssertionError           If the equality of the modified object is inconsistent with the changes made to its property.
